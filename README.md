### Work Experience  
**Connecticut Department of Public Health**  
**Research Analyst**  
January 2024-Present  
Currently I work with a wide range of data sources to create interactive and static Power BI reports for stakeholders. The reports are used by internal management staff as well as the public. 

**Connecticut Department of Public Health**  
**Epidemiologist, Informatics Unit**  
December 2021-January 2024  
    Worked on the electronic case reporting (eCR) project, where I helped to map elements from the Consolidated Clinical Document (CCD) to fields in the Connecticut Electronic Disease Surveillance System (CTEDSS). I also completed data analysis and validation on the health data from senders using a combination of PowerShell and extensible stylesheet transformations (XSLTs). Knowledge of PowerShell, XSLT, and eCR allowed me to develop scripts that were shared at the Council for State Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and provided to the public on GitHub. Power BI along with Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) were used to create dashboards and reports to communicate findings to stakeholders. Dimensional data modeling, star schemas in particular, were used with to create eCR Power BI dashboards to facilitate the reporting of data. 
    Additionally, I provided assistance with reconciliation of case data in CTEDSS, manipulation of spreadsheets for rostering, and crosswalked outside data to system fields. For recurring rosters, I developed a Visual Basic script to make data manipulation easier for staff. I also used R programming language to create functions that are used with eCR and electronic laboratory report (ELR) data. The code that I developed is typically stored in version control programs such as OneDrive, GitHub, or the state Azure DevOps repositories. Finally, I worked with the Casetivity team to develop online submission forms for COVID, Chlamydia, and Gonorrhea. These forms automate the upload of case data by mapping the fields from the user interface to an XML that can be uploaded to CTEDSS.  

**Center for Advanced Reproductive Services**  
**Medical Technologist, Farmington, CT**  
December 2017-December 2021  
Reported laboratory results using Electronic Health Record (EHR) and communicate with clinical teams abnormal results. This position required me to speak and interview patients about their treatment plan and be knowledgeable in medical/insurance codes (ICD-9 and ICD-10) and proficient with electronic laboratory records. I  worked to educate Connecticut hospitals and patients about sperm cryopreservation prior to chemotherapy. I conducted trend analyses of clinic and patient data to assist with better scheduling and identify areas of improvement. Regularly changed data elements in video conferencing software (Microsoft Teams), scheduling application, and EHR for improved user experience. Assisted technical administrators with ultrasound Structured Reporting (SR) to the EHR by documenting user requests to allow for better flow of digital information in the healthcare system. Created and executed a research project investigating the effectiveness of new cryopreservation media for freezing of sperm cells.  


**University of Connecticut Health Center**  
**Contractor- Graduate Teaching Assistant, Farmington, CT**  
January 2019-May 2021  
Graduate Teaching Assistant for four MPH graduate level classes, including: Behavioral and Social Public Health, Law and Public Health, Epidemiology and Biostatistics I, and Epidemiology and Biostatistics II. I teach and communicate to students important concepts for public health practice by creating documentation, training presentations, and assessments. Currently, I am training students to use analytic software (SPSS) for analysis of population health data. I regularly take the time to review materials outside of class with students and answer phone calls or emails to resolve issues. In addition, I collaborate with another Teaching Assistant to create a welcoming learning environment for students.  

**Connecticut Department of Public Health**  
**Public Health Practicum, Hartford, CT**  
March 2019- July 2019  
Reportable Conditions Knowledge Management System (RCKMS) Development is a public health surveillance system which includes creating trigger criteria for nationally notifiable infectious diseases. The project involved interviews with lead epidemiologists from a number of CT DPH sections to meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. I changed data elements within RCKMS for optimal recognition of notifiable conditions from electronic initial case reports and reviewed changes against LOINC-SNOMED code sets for consistency. I collaborated with my practicum preceptors to complete the project in a timely manner. Communicated the results of the RCKMS project with DPH staff through powerpoint presentation and user training handout. Also worked with Connecticut Electronic Disease Surveillance System (CTEDSS-Maven) by cleaning demographic records and thoroughly reviewing for laboratory discrepancies.  
	

**Avista Pharma Solutions**  
**Micro Analyst II, Agawam, MA**  
May 2014-December 2017  
At Avista Pharma Solutions, I worked inside client cleanroom facilities to determine bacterial, fungal, and particulate levels in the environmental. In addition, I performed trend analyses with client testing data to identify contamination “hot spots” in their clean environments and suggested testing sites for better surveillance. I also worked in the microbiology laboratory testing pre-sterilized pharmaceutical and medical devices for bioburden and action organisms. Communicated with clients about testing results that may have triggered their facility specific alert levels. I quickly resolved client issues onsite or in the laboratory by problem solving and thinking on my feet. Created a medical device testing database for streamlining client orders and maximizing analyst testing schedules. Experience with creating documentation, standard operating procedures, and user training for laboratory testing.  

**University of Connecticut**  
**Research Assistant, Storrs, CT**  
January 2014-May 2014  
In the Pathobiology Department I worked under the direction of Dr.Neha Mishra and Principal Investigator Dr.Joan Smyth, investigating methods of creating immunity against Clostridium perfringens in chicken and turkey flocks. Job duties consisted of laboratory management, bacterial culture and isolation, operation of protein isolation machines, and research animal care. In addition, regular phone calls to manufacturers were needed to obtain specialized materials for the research project.
